## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 medium-sized onion chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic minced
- 1 bell pepper chopped
- 1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas (or one 15 oz can, drained and rinsed)
- 1/2 cup tomato sauce (passata)
- 3 tbsp hot sauce (or more to taste)
- 2 tbsp plant-based milk
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 3/4 tsp coconut sugar (or brown sugar)
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- Sea salt & black pepper to taste
- Chili powder to taste

## Instructions

- Using a fork, roughly mash the chickpeas in a bowl.
- Heat oil in a pan/skillet over medium heat and add the chopped onion
  and bell pepper. Cook for 3 minutes, then add garlic and spice mix and
  sauté for a further minute.
- Add all other sauce ingredients + chickpeas to the pan and bring the
  mixture to a boil. Let simmer on low heat for about 2-4 minutes,
  stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat.
- Taste the mixture, if you want it spicier, add more chili powder to
  taste.
- Preheat oven to 410 degrees F (210 degrees C) and line a baking sheet
  with parchment paper.
- Place about 2 tbsp of the filling onto each tortilla and roll them up
  tightly. Place every tortilla seam-side down on the baking sheet, next
  to each other.
- Brush them with a little bit of vegetable oil (to make them even more
  crispy).
- Bake in the oven for about 15-20 minutes or until they are golden
  brown and crispy.
- Drizzle with vegan cheese sauce (optional). Enjoy with your favorite
  dip!
